# üå§Ô∏è Info

This is a tiny front-end app (**HTML/CSS/JS**) that shows the current weather for **Troy, NY** using **OpenWeatherMap** and then suggests cozy recipe ideas from **TheMealDB** that fit the weather vibe.  

The weather condition (e.g., *Rain*, *Clear*, *Snow*) maps to a few ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù keywords like *soup*, *ramen*, *stew*, or *salad*. The app queries **TheMealDB** with several keywords, merges and de-duplicates results, and if there still aren‚Äôt enough items, falls back to a broad category and finally a couple of random meals.  

There‚Äôs also a **‚ÄúPretend Weather‚Äù tester** so you can preview rainy/snowy suggestions instantly.

# üß± Work Log

- Started by wiring **OpenWeatherMap** (lat/lon for Troy, `units=imperial`) and rendering the basic weather fields.  
- Initially tried a **music recommendation** approach with **Last.fm**, mapping weather ‚Üí mood and fetching tracks via `tag.getTopTracks` for compound tags like ‚Äúk-pop rainy.‚Äù  
  - Result: too sparse/inconsistent, so pivoted.  
- Switched to **TheMealDB** (no key required):
  - Implemented multiple weather-driven keywords  
  - Added **category & random fallbacks**, plus **de-duplication** and a **Fisher‚ÄìYates shuffle**  
- Fixed layout issue where long recipe titles were cut off by switching to a **two-column CSS grid**.  
- Final cleanup focused on:
  - Clear `fetch` calls with `async/await`
  - Use of `URLSearchParams`
  - Minimal, clean UI

# üí° What I Learned

- Practiced reading **API docs** and translating parameters into working requests  
- Handled **uneven data** by chaining queries and creating fallback logic  
- Debugged **front-end issues** like array merging, shuffle bugs, and text wrapping  
- Learned to keep a simple stack (HTML/CSS/JS) to make the **data flow and Fetch API** behavior transparent
